# == eBay API Client for Ruby
#
# * Simple and easy to use Ruby implementation.
# * Ability to return a raw response for calls that return an extremely large response such as GetCategoriesRequest.
# * Up-to-date with the eBay API version 947 (see lib/ebay/schema/ebaySvc.xsd, all ruby classes are compiled from that xsd)
# * Months of usage in a production environment.
# * Support for Platform Notifications baked right in.
#
# For examples of many common tasks see the examples folder.
#
# See Rakefile for how to update the xsd and regenerate classes
#
# I did:
# rvm use 1.9.3 (installed the older gems in gemspec) for me rvm use 1.9.3@ebay gem set
# bundle exec rake schema:update #downloads new xsd, updates version
# make the following changes to xsd
#
e.g.
<xs:element name="ShowSellerProfilePreferences" type="xs:boolean">
<xs:element name="ShowSellerProfilePreferences" type="xs:boolean" minOccurs="0">

on the following nodes: (the xsd is plain wrong, if you match with ebay api example docs, they are optional)
