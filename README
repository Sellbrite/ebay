# == eBay API Client for Ruby
#
# * Simple and easy to use Ruby implementation.
# * Ability to return a raw response for calls that return an extremely large response such as GetCategoriesRequest.
# * Up-to-date with the eBay API version 907 (see ebaySvc.xsd, all ruby classes are compiled from that xsd)
# * Months of usage in a production environment.
# * Support for Platform Notifications baked right in.
#
# For examples of many common tasks see the examples folder.
#
# See Rakefile for how to update the xsd and regenerate classes
#
# I did:
# rvm use 1.9.3 (installed the older gems in gemspec)
# bundle exec rake classes:generate
